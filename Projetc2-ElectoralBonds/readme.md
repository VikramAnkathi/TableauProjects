### Electoral Bonds Insights

This dashboard is developed using tableau public.

**Dataset:**

**Title:** Indian Electoral Bonds Dataset.

**Description:**
The dataset emerges amidst significant legal and regulatory developments surrounding electoral bonds in India. The Election Commission of India (ECI), in compliance with orders from the Supreme Court (SC), mandated the State Bank of India (SBI) to furnish details regarding electoral bonds. Following the SC's ruling declaring the 2018 scheme unconstitutional, the SBI was directed to disclose electoral bond data to the ECI by March 15, 2024. This dataset encapsulates the information disclosed by the ECI on its website.
